# DevOps-Centric Web Application with Real-Time Monitoring & Deployment

**Project Overview:**

You will build a full-stack web application that provides a dashboard for users to interact with, which supports both real-time data streaming and a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This app will also include secure APIs, logging, and monitoring using AWS services. You'll use modern DevOps practices like Jenkins for automation, GitHub for version control, and implement secure coding practices.



**Technologies:**


- Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript (React for frontend, Node.js for backend)
- DevOps Tools: GitHub, Jenkins, AWS CloudWatch, AWS CodeDeploy
- Security Tools: JWT for authentication, SSL, OAuth 2.0, SAST, DevSecOps practices
- Data Stores: MySQL and MongoDB
- Cloud Services: AWS (SQS for data streaming, Kinesis for real-time processing, CloudWatch for monitoring)
- CI/CD Pipelines: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, AWS CodeDeploy
- Frameworks: React (Frontend), Node.js (Backend)
- APIs: REST API for communication between frontend and backend








By the end of this project, I will have built a fully functional web application with a CI/CD pipeline, secure REST APIs, real-time data processing, and monitoring while implementing secure coding practices.
